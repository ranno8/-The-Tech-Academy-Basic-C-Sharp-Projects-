# The Tech Academy Basic C# Projects  
This repository contains my C# and .NET Framework projects completed during The Tech Academy coursework. 

## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains my coding projects and assignments from the C# course at AOLCC College in Brampton. The focus of this course has been on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#, and it covers essential topics such as data types, variable assignment, branching, loops, and more. I will be updating this repository as I complete each assignment and project throughout the course.

## About This Repository
- Purpose**: This repository tracks my progress in learning C# and OOP concepts through assignments, coding exercises, and practice projects.  
- Projects**: As I complete each section of the course, I will add the projects here with explanations and relevant code files.  
- Project Organization**: Each project will be organized in its own folder with source code and documentation.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language**: C#  
- Framework**: .NET Framework  
- Development Tools**: Visual Studio  
- Version Control**: GitHub  

## Course Topics Covered
The following topics have been covered in the Object-Oriented Programming module of the C# course:
1. Basic OOP Definitions**: Introduction to key OOP concepts such as objects, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
2. The .NET Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)**: A high-level understanding of how the .NET framework works.
3. The C# Compiler**: How the C# compiler processes and compiles code.
4. Writing and Running Basic C# Code**: Introduction to the syntax and structure of C# programs using Visual Studio.
5. Data Types in C#**: Understanding and using data types, including primitive and complex types in C#.
6. Casting in C#**: Converting between different data types in C#.
7. Variable Assignment**: Working with variables and constants in C#.
8. Mathematical Operations**: Performing basic arithmetic operations in C#.
9. Comparison Operations**: Using comparison operators to evaluate conditions in C#.
10. Creating Simple Console Applications**: Building a basic console application in C#.
11. Branching**: Implementing conditional statements (if, else, switch) for decision-making.
12. Operators in C#**: Using operators such as arithmetic, logical, and relational operators.
13. Loops in C#**: Implementing loops (for, while, do-while) to repeat actions.
14. Strings in C#**: Working with string manipulation, concatenation, and formatting.

## Projects in This Repository
As I complete the assignments and exercises for each topic, they will be added here. Here's a list of the initial projects:
1. Project 1 - Basic C# Console Application**: A simple console application using basic syntax and data types.
2. Project 2 - Branching and Loops**: Implementing branching (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while) in a C# program.
3. Project 3 - Data Types and Operations**: Using variables, data types, and performing basic mathematical and comparison operations.
4. Project 4 - String Manipulation**: A program demonstrating string operations such as concatenation and formatting.
